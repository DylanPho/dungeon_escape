## Educational Value
This project demonstrates several key programming concepts:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
  - Classes and inheritance for game elements (e.g., Player, Monster, Items).
- Polymorphism:
  - Dynamic handling of different object interactions.
- Data Structures:
  - Efficient storage of rooms, inventory, and connections.
- Recursive Functions:
  - Implementing room traversal logic.
